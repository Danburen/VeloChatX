# The keys corresponding to the display must match the server names in Velocity.toml -> [servers]

# @from version 1.4.0
# Group each server
# A channel group can have multiple sub-servers, and a server can belong to multiple channels
# When a server appears in multiple channels simultaneously, {channel} is replaced with the first server it appears in
# If global is set to false, only servers in the same channel can communicate with each other
# If global is set to true, messages from all servers (whether in the channel or not) will be communicated
# If a server is not in the channel, it will default to global, and {channel} placeholder will be replaced with an empty string
