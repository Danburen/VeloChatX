# Sub-server localized scheduled broadcasts
# 【Please note】
# 1. If global broadcast enable = false, only the sub-server's broadcasts will be broadcasted
# 2. channel-list and server-list include all the servers and channels in which this broadcast will be applied
# 3. If a server or channel appears in multiple sub-server broadcasts:
#     i. Prefix will only inherit the last broadcast's prefix
#     ii. Identical messages in different broadcasts will be merged, repeating messages will not increase their occurrence
# 4. If the same sub-server broadcast name appears multiple times, only the first read broadcast will be used
locale:
